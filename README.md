# seed_cold_tolerance

This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the analysis and figures presented in Ladwig, Henn, Stahlheber, and Meiners, 2024. "Germination response to winter temperatures changes with seed shape and length of temperature exposure" Ecology.

There are two R scripts:
1. lab_experiment.R: This script contains the code needed to reproduce the results of the lab experiment examining seed damage under different freezing treatments and how seed traits relate to this damage.

2. field_experiment.R: This script contains the code needed to reproduce the results of the field experiment examining seed germination responses to temperture exposure in the field.

There is also one data file: "col_dates.csv", which contains the field collection dates from the field experiment.

All other data used here are archived with the Environmental Data Initiative here: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/e84a56f6aca6775b626bcbdc5f222842
